tic12400-register-value-blob-**parser**

tic12400 binary register value blob parser (**interpreter**)

That is a utility tool to **interpret** the raw binary tic12400 **47x** **24bit** registers **values blob** to **human** readable *.txt configuration **report** according the tic12400 **datasheet**. As a example there are **data-in** and **data-out** files for tic12400 *.txt.
Users all over the World may appreciate that **diagnostic** tool and such **support** for tic12400-Q1 chip .

1) 47x tic12400-Q1 24bit registers values themselves must be read from **tic12400 chip** via **SPI** bus to **MCU** **RAM**. 
2) Than **binary blob** (**1128 bits**) must be **transferred** from **MCU RAM** to **PC disc** (in **txt** file) via **UART**, RS232, 100-Base-TX, Bluetooth, WiFi, CAN or **any other interface**.
3) Finally **on PC** that utility tool can **instantly** **interpret** chip **settings** and **reveal** honest tic12400-Q1 **configuration**.

That is a very **handy tool** for **diagnostic** and **bug search**.
