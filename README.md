tic12400 binary register value blob parser (interpreter)

That is a utility tool to interpret the raw binary tic12400  registers values blob to human readable *.txt configuration report according the tic12400 datasheet. As a example there are data in and data out for tic12400 *.txt. Users all over the world may appreciate that diagnostic tool and such support of tic12400 .

1) 47 tic12400 24bit registers values themselves must be read from tic12400 chip via SPI bus to MCU RAM. 
2) Than binary blob must be transferred from MCU RAM to PC disc (in txt file) via UART, 100-Base-TX, Bluetooth, WiFi, CAN or any other interface.
3) Finally on PC that utility tool can interpret chip settings and reveal honest tic12400 configuration.

That is a very handy tool for diagnostic and bug search.
